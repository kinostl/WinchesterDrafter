Just download it and run index.html in your web browser. It might have some errors due to how it pulls from the MtG Api. Only works locally. If you wanna use it with another person over the internet, just stream your window in Discord and then send them their Dek file.

Select the set you wanna draft out of by changing the default `ktk` to whatever set symbol is correct.
